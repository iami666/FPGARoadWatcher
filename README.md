FPGA Road Watcher
=================

Small project that implements some image filtering functions
to extract informations from the road using a FPGA, and process them on an ARM.

The layout and FPGA programming is done using Xilinx Vivado and the image filtering
part use (a subset of) OpenCV functions.
